# DUOpenMarket
Open Source Third-Party Market API for Dual Universe

## What is the DUOpenMarket Desktop Client?
The DUOpenMarket Desktop client actively scrapes your logfiles while you play Dual Universe. It sends the market data for any items you search for ingame, to our servers, where we can share it with others who may not be logged into the game. We strongly encourage players to keep the DUOpenMarket Desktop client open in the background while they play the game normally. If everyone did that, our database would always be up to date.

## What information does DUOpenMarket collect?
The DUOpenMarket Desktop client ONLY accesses logfiles created by Dual Universe. Our servers occasionally collect IP information when a request is made, to help us improve the quality of our service and eliminate bots. We do not collect any personally identifiable information or other analytical data about our users, or their devices.

## Does the DUOpenMarket Client violate NovaQuark's TOS?
Simply put, NO. DUOpenMarket is perfectly legal to use and infact there are many tools that predate this one, which do similar things. The client only reads from log files which are created by Dual Universe. It does not read game files. It does not modify, update, move, or delete, any files other than its own.
